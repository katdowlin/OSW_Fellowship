# OSW_Fellowship
Offshore Wind Farm Fellowship using ML to optimize the maintance of offshore wind farms 
Author: Katharina Dowlin  

This project, completed as part of the New Jersey Wind Institute Fellowship, focuses on applying supervised machine learning techniques to optimize maintenance operations for offshore wind farms. The aim is to improve the scheduling and reliability of maintenance by predicting potential turbine failures based on SCADA and environmental data.

## Objectives  
- Develop predictive models to forecast component failures and downtime  
- Analyze SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and weather data to identify key failure patterns  
- Evaluate different machine learning algorithms for maintenance optimization  
- Provide decision-making tools for scheduling proactive maintenance  

## Methods   
- **ML Models**:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, Catboost)  

## Features   
- Wind speed, direction  
- Rotor speed  
- Gearbox temperature  
- Generator power output
